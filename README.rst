You can use this WordPress plugin to force users away from the default
WordPress login and registration forms.  Users attempting to access
"/wp-login" to login to WordPress will be redirected to "/customer-sign-in".
Users attempting to register via "/wp-login" will be redirected to "/pricing".

This plugin will still allow logouts through "/wp-login".

You may also be interested in the `Inesonic Force Login URL plugin
<https://github.com/tuxidriver/inesonic-force-login-url>`.  Both plugins are
used by `Inesonic <https://inesonic.com>` infrastructure.
